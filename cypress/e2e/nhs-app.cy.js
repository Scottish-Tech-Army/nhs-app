/// <reference types="cypress" />

// Welcome to Cypress!
//
// This spec file contains a variety of sample tests
// for a todo list app that are designed to demonstrate
// the power of writing tests in Cypress.
//
// To learn more about how Cypress works and
// what makes it such an awesome testing tool,
// please read our getting started guide:
// https://on.cypress.io/introduction-to-cypress

describe('example to-do app', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Cypress starts out with a blank slate for each test
    // so we must tell it to visit our website with the `cy.visit()` command.
    // Since we want to visit the same URL at the start of all our tests,
    // we include it in our beforeEach function so that it runs before each test
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000')
  })

 
  it('can check off an item as completed', () => {
    // In addition to using the `get` command to get an element by selector,
    // we can also use the `contains` command to get an element by its contents.
    // However, this will yield the <label>, which is lowest-level element that contains the text.
    // In order to check the item, we'll find the <input> element for this <label>
    // by traversing up the dom to the parent element. From there, we can `find`
    // the child checkbox <input> element and use the `check` command to check it.
    cy.contains('Pay electric bill')
      .parent()
      .find('input[type=checkbox]')
      .check()

    // Now that we've checked the button, we can go ahead and make sure
    // that the list element is now marked as completed.
    // Again we'll use `contains` to find the <label> element and then use the `parents` command
    // to traverse multiple levels up the dom until we find the corresponding <li> element.
    // Once we get that element, we can assert that it has the completed class.
    cy.contains('Pay electric bill')
      .parents('li')
      .should('have.class', 'completed')
